  <string name="parachain_staking_story_collator_page_1">Collators maintain parachains by collecting parachain transactions from users and producing state transition proofs for Relay Chain validators. In other words, collators aggregate parachain transactions into parachain block candidates and produce state transition proofs for validators based on those blocks.</string>
  <string name="parachain_staking_story_collator_page_2">A collator runs a blockchain node 24/7 and is required to have enough stake locked (both owned and provided by delegators) to be elected by the network. Collators should maintain their nodes\' performance and reliability to be rewarded. Being a collator is almost a full-time job.\nEveryone can be a collator and run a blockchain node, but doing so requires a certain level of technical skills and responsibility.</string>
  <string name="parachain_staking_story_collator_title">Who’s a collator?</string>
  <string name="parachain_staking_story_delegator_page_1">Delegators are token holders who stake tokens, vouching for specific collator candidates. Any user that holds a minimum amount of tokens as free balance can become a delegator.</string>
  <string name="parachain_staking_story_delegator_page_2">Delegators should check their stake states regularly. It is possible that staking balance falls below the minimum required amount to receive rewards or even be a delegator. In the worst-case scenario, your staking slot may be replaced by another delegator with a higher stake and your stake could be pushed out and immediately returned to your balance.</string>
  <string name="parachain_staking_story_delegator_title">Who’s a delegator?</string>
  <string name="parachain_staking_story_rewards_page_1">Reward pool - a portion of the annual inflation that is set aside for collators and delegators.\nRewards for collators and their delegators are calculated at the start of every round for their work prior to the reward payout delay.\nThe calculated rewards are then paid out on a block-by-block basis. For every block, one collator will be chosen to receive their entire reward payout from the prior round, along with their delegators, until all of the rewards have been paid for that round.</string>
  <string name="parachain_staking_story_rewards_page_2">Delegators get rewards after a reward payout delay. Payout delays are a certain amount of rounds which must pass before staking rewards are distributed automatically to the free balance.\nReward distribution to some delegators may be stopped because of two possible reasons; A collator hasn\'t been chosen by the network for creating blocks, or decided to leave the candidate pool. Another reason is having a stake amount lower than the minimum collator bond.</string>

  <string name="staking_story_nominator_page_1">Nominators earn passive income by locking their tokens to secure the network. To achieve that, the nominator should select a number of validators to support. The nominator should be careful when selecting validators. If the selected validator doesn’t behave properly, slashing penalties would be applied to both of them based on the severity of the incident.</string>
  <string name="staking_story_nominator_page_2">Fearless Wallet provides a support to nominators by helping them select validators. The mobile app fetches data from the blockchain and composes a list of validators, who have the most profits, identity with contact info, no slashes and are available to receive nominations. Fearless Wallet also cares about decentralization, so if one person or a company runs several validator nodes, only up to 2 nodes of theirs will be shown in the recommended list.</string>
  <string name="staking_story_nominator_title">Who is a nominator?</string>
  <string name="staking_story_reward_page_1">Rewards for staking are available to payout at the end of each era (6 hours in Kusama and 24 hours in Polkadot). The network stores pending rewards for 84 eras, and in most cases validators pay out the rewards for everyone. However, validators might forget or something might happen to them, so nominators can payout their rewards by themselves.</string>
  <string name="staking_story_reward_page_2">Although rewards are usually distributed by validators, Fearless Wallet helps by alerting if there are any pending rewards that are close to expiring. You will receive alerts about this and other activities on the staking screen.</string>
  <string name="staking_story_reward_title">Receiving rewards</string>
  <string name="staking_story_staking_page_1">Staking is an option to earn passive income by locking your tokens in the network. Staking rewards are allocated every era (6 hours on Kusama and 24 hours on Polkadot). You can stake as long as you wish, and to unstake your tokens, you need to wait for the unstaking period to end, making your tokens available to be redeemed.</string>
  <string name="staking_story_staking_page_2">Staking is an important part of network security and reliability. Anyone can run validator nodes, but only those who have enough tokens staked will be elected by the network to participate in composing new blocks and receive the rewards. Validators often do not have enough tokens of their own, so nominators are helping them by locking their tokens for them to achieve the required amount of stake.</string>
  <string name="staking_story_staking_title">What is staking?</string>
  <string name="staking_story_validator_page_1">The validator runs a blockchain node 24/7 and is required to have enough stake locked (both owned and provided by nominators) to be elected by the network. Validators should maintain their nodes\' performance and reliability to be rewarded. Being a validator is almost a full-time job, there are companies that are focused on validating on blockchain networks.</string>
  <string name="staking_story_validator_page_2">Everyone can be a validator and run a blockchain node, but that requires a certain level of technical skills and responsibility. Polkadot and Kusama networks have a program named Thousand Validators Programme to provide support to beginners. Moreover, the network itself will always reward more validators who have less stake (but enough to be elected) to improve decentralization.</string>
